# Primitive and reference types
In Java, all *data types* are separated into two groups: **primitive types** and **reference types**.

Java provides only eight primitive types. They are built-in in the language syntax as *keywords*.
The names of all primitive types are lowercase. The most commonly used type is int which represents 
an *integer number*.
```
int num = 100;
```
The number of reference types is huge and constantly growing. A programmer can even create their own
type and use it like standard types. The most frequently used reference types are String, Scanner
and arrays. Remember that Java, like most programming languages, is case sensitive.

In this topic, we will focus on String, which is a common example of the reference type.

## The new keyword
In most cases, an *object* of a reference type can be created using the new keyword. When we use 
the new keyword, the *memory* is allocated for the object we create. That is called *instantiation*
of the object because we create an *instance* of it. Then we initialize the variable by assigning 
some value to it. Often, as in our example, it is done with one line.
```
String language = new String("java");
//instantiation of String and initialization with "java"
```
You can also use a literal for strings:
```
String language = "java";
```
The first approach with the keyword new is common for reference types, while the second is only
string-specific. Both approaches give us the same result for strings but they have some technical
differences which we will not consider here.

## The main difference
The basic difference between primitive and reference types is that a variable of a primitive type
stores the actual values, whereas a variable of a reference type stores an address in memory
(reference) where the data is located. The data can be presented as a complex structure that includes
other data types as their parts.

The following picture simply demonstrates this difference. There are two main memory spaces: **stack**
and **heap**. All values of primitive types are stored in stack memory, but variables of reference
types store addresses of objects located in heap memory.

We will not consider stack and heap in detail here. Just remember this difference between 
primitive and reference types.

## Assignment
The way to store data also affects the mechanism to assign the value of a variable to another
variable:
- **primitive types**: the value is just copied;
- **reference types**: the address to the value is copied (the data is shared between several variables).

Here is a snippet of code and a picture that demonstrates this.
```
int a = 100;
int b = a; // 100 is copied to b

String language = new String("java");
String java = language;
```
The variable b has a copy of the value stored in the variable a. But the variables language and java
reference the same value, rather than copying it. The picture below clearly demonstrates the difference.

Just remember, when assigning one value of a *reference variable* to another, we just make a copy of
a reference rather than the value itself.

## Comparisons
Comparing reference types using == and != is not the same as comparing primitive types. Actually,
when you are comparing two variables of the String type, it compares references (addresses) rather
than actual values.

The following code demonstrates it:
```
String s1 = new String("java");
String s2 = new String("java");
String s3 = s2;

System.out.println(s1 == s2); // false
System.out.println(s2 == s3); // true
```
The picture below demonstrates this effect:

![img_3.png](img_3.png)

So, you should not use comparison operators when you want to compare the values. The correct way
to compare content is to invoke the special method equals.
```
String s1 = new String("java");
String s2 = new String("java");
String s3 = s2;

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true
System.out.println(s2.equals(s3)); // true
```

## The null type
Unlike primitive types, a variable of a reference type can refer to a special null value that
represents the fact that it is not initialized yet or doesn't have a value.
```
String str = null;
System.out.println(str); // null
str = "hello";
System.out.println(str); // hello
```
The following statement with a primitive type won't compile.
```
int n = null; // it won't compile
```
Unfortunately, the frequent use of the null value can easily lead to errors in the program and
complicate the code. Try to avoid null whenever it is possible, only use it if you really need it.
